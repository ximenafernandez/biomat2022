This repository contains all the lectures and code related to the course.

### Lecture 1: Topological Data Analysis
This lecture is about a general exposition of Persistent Homology and some applications. The slides of the lecture are available <a href="https://ximenafernandez.github.io/reveal.js-presentations/slides/PersistentHomology.html"> here</a>.
The demo of the software Ripser can be found at <a href="https://live.ripser.org/"> this link</a>. The synthetic point clouds to test the software are available at the folder _data_: cicle, sphere and torus.

### Lecture 2: Hands on: computational topology in action
This lecture is a live-coding exposition of the use of the software Ripser to compute Persistent Homology, and some real applications with concrete data. The datasets are available at the folder _data_.

The notebook _Intro_Persistent_Homology.ipynb_ provides a complete description and implementation of tools related to the computation of persistent homology with the software Ripser. It also contains  some simulations in synthetic point clouds to describe properties of persistent homology and to infer topological features from a sample.

The notebooks with the implementation of several applications from the literature can be found at the folder _applications_:
 - 
 - _Example_CycloOctane.ipynb_:
 - _Example_GridCells.ipynb_:
 - _Proteins_Binding.ipynb_:
 - _Proteins_Structure_Classification.ipynb_: 

### Lecture 3: Applications in dynamics
This lecture is about some applications of Persistent Homology to study dynamical systems and analize time series. The slides of this lecture can be found <a href="https://"> here </a>.
Some of the applications are based on recent work of the author: 
- **Birdsongs**:<a href="https://github.com/ximenafernandez/intrinsicPH"> Repository IntrinsicPH </a> 
- **iEEG and MEG**: <a href="https://github.com/ximenafernandez/epipepsy"> Repository Epilepsy </a>
